<p>Robot programming for novice users is becoming increasingly
attractive.  Most robot programs are inherently distributed and
event-driven, while distributed programming is, however, often
difficult and error-prone even for experienced programmers. </p>

<p>We have designed an approach for event-driven programming of
general-purpose distributed systems which allows the programmer to
have a simple sequential semantics and a unified model of the system
as a whole.  Consequently, the programmer does not have to worry about
data consistency and concurrency bugs, as our runtime framework is in
charge of synchronizing all requests and keeping all nodes updated.
We have implemented a prototype of this approach for client-server
applications in Java.</p>

<p>As Java is not commonly used for robot programming, the main goal
of this UROP project is to port our existing Java implementation to <a
href="http://www.ros.org">ROS</a>, and further adapt it to the
particular needs of robot programmers.  ROS already provides many
high-level concepts for message passing communication between the
nodes, so implementing our event-driven concepts for ROS should be
much simpler than doing the same for Java.  The most interesting part
of this project should be learning about ROS, identifying common
programming tasks in robotics, and re-implementing those tasks as
examples using the new event-driven framework.</p>

<p>This project is most suitable for a student interested in robotics,
and learning more about robot programming in ROS.  ROS officially
supports Python as one of the front-end programming languages, but
also has "experimental" front-end for a subset of Java (compatible
with Java for Android), so the student will get to choose between
those two target platforms.</p>
