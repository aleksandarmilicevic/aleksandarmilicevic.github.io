<p>We have implemented a model-based web framework on top of Ruby on
Rails for building event-driven interactive web applications.  The
core of our framework is an information-rich model which enables the
framework to automatically synthesize many parts of the application at
runtime, on the fly.  For example, there are no controllers, and the
programmer does not have to write database migrations, ActiveRecrod
association ends (reflections), routes, etc.  Furthermore, the
framework keeps track of all connected clients and the data they are
displaying, so whenever the value of a piece of data changes, the
framework immediately propagates that change to all the relevant
clients (using the "server push" mechanism).  The clients then know
how to automatically refresh their views (by updating the DOM), thanks
to our smart views (written as regular templates but data binding
enabled); as a result, the programmer does not have to write any Ajax
code to get a responsive, auto-refreshing GUI.</p>

<p class="task">Currently, the programmer has to manually write the
views for his or her application (which are conceptually no different
from the standard ERB templates commonly used in Rails applications).
This part could be automated as well, which is exactly the main
<u>goal of this UROP project</u>: provide a generic user interface,
out of the box, directly generated from the core application model,
which simply allows the user to view and query the current object
state.  Alternatively, the student may choose to implement a WYSIWYG
UI builder that lets the programmer quickly design GUIs automatically
tied to the domain model.</p>

<p>The student joining this project should already be comfortable with
Javascript, and ideally familiar with some Javascript UI libraries, as
this project is mostly about designing snappy looking widgets for
visualizing the application object state.  The most challenging part
of the project is to come up with a clever, generic, model-based UI,
preferably customizable so that it can be tweaked and fine tuned
differently for different concrete applications.</p>

<p>This is not a building a one-off GUI for a given app kind of
project; rather, this project is about building a set of generic,
template-based widgets, that reflectively read the application model
(e.g., "<emph>what are the all different model classes in this
system?</emph>", "<emph>what are the fields of this particular model
class and what are their types?</emph>", etc.), dynamically query the
application state (e.g., "<emph>give me all the instances of this
class</emph>", "<emph>what is the value of this field in this concrete
instance</emph>", etc.), and display all that data in a meaningful and
intuitive way.  Fortunately, all these technical and infrastructural
problems have already been taken care of, so the student will be able
to focus solely on being creative and designing a nice general-purpose
GUI.</p>
