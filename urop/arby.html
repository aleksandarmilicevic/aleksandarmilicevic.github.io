<p><a href="http://alloy.mit.edu" title="Alloy---first-order
relational model finder">Alloy</a> is a first-order, relational,
modeling language.  Alloy is declarative (based on logic), and as
such, it is not executable per se; it is instead used primarily to
formally model systems for the purpose of checking various logical
properties against them.  Being purely declarative, however, makes
a number of tasks difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>aRby---an embedding of Alloy in Ruby---demonstrates the benefits of
having a declarative modeling language (backed by an automated solver)
embedded in a traditional object-oriented imperative programming
language.  aRby aims to bring the two opposing paradigms
(imperative and declarative) closer together in a novel and unique
way. We show that having the other paradigm available within the same
language is beneficial to both the modeling community of Alloy users
and the object-oriented community of Ruby programmers. aRby provides
elegant solutions to several well-known, outstanding Alloy problems:
(1) mixed execution, (2) specifying partial instances, (3) staged
model finding.</p>

<!-- Most of Alloy's expressive power, however, -->
<!-- comes from its relational base and its relational operators, which, in -->
<!-- contrast, can be efficiently executable in the context of -->
<!-- object-oriented programs.  Even the first-order quantifiers ("all" and -->
<!-- "exists") can be executed using a straightforward iterative search -->
<!-- over the bounded domains of quantified variables, which can be -->
<!-- appropriate when the domain is small and/or the constraints are -->
<!-- simple. -->

<!-- <p>The main goal of this project is to design a language for writing -->
<!-- Alloy models directly in Ruby.  The idea is to find a -->
<!-- middle ground and have a single language with two execution modes: -->
<!-- symbolic (translates to Alloy) and concrete (executes directly inside -->
<!-- the Ruby interpreter).  Such a language could be used either (1) as a -->
<!-- modeling language (for writing complex models in logic for the purpose -->
<!-- of formal analysis, but having a full-blown Ruby for any -->
<!-- pre/post-processing), (2) as an imperative OO programming language -->
<!-- inside Ruby, with added benefits of runtime checks of simple -->
<!-- properties, or (3) anywhere in between.</p> -->

<p class="task">We have already implemented a working prototype.  The student
joining this project would work on exploring some exciting new
posibilities this new paradigm (of using imperative code to produce
declarative specifications) enables.  This project spans across many
topics of programming language research (listed above; familiarity is
by no means a prerequisite), and being involved in such a broad
project would be of great benefit to someone interested in pursuing
graduate education in the area of programming languages and program
analysis.</p>
