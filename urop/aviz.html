<p>The <a href="http://alloy.mit.edu" title="Alloy---first-order
relational model finder">Alloy Analyzer</a> is an automated constraint
solver for first-order relational logic.  Alloy represents found
solutions as typed object graphs, which are automatically visualized
(using a predetermined layout algorithm) and presented to the
user.</p>

<p>We have recently implemented a set of new layout algorithms, which
provide more flexibility, but also require certain configuration by
the user.  One of the most exciting new features is the notion a
composite layout algorithm, where the user can select different layout
algorithms to be used for different parts of the object graph.  The
only missing part, which is the main task of this project, is to
implement a UI to allows the user to make that selection in a visual,
convenient and intuitive way.</p>

<p>Aside from using Java and Swing to develop UI widgets, the student
will also learn about, and will have to work (to some extent) with,
Alloy's first-order relational logic and its automated solver, which
is a valuable and exciting topic for someone interested in continuing
to study programming languages, constraint solving, software analysis,
and software design.</p>
